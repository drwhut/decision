Hi, and welcome to the user manual of Decision!

##############
About Decision
##############

Decision is a **general-purpose**, **visual** programming language designed
to make your programming experience **intuitive**. With it, you can:

* Create and run scripts.
* Create and load libraries for scripts to run.
* Import it into any C/C++ project for use as a scripting language.

In terms of being a programming language, it is also:

* A strongly typed language, meaning it has set data types, and you cannot mix
  them.

* A compiled language, which means it compiles to an *intermediate bytecode*,
  which gets directly run by a virtual machine.

This user manual will explain how one can create scripts in Decision, how to
run those scripts, how to create and load libraries, everything you would want
to know to take full advantage of the project.

If however, you want to know more about *how* the language works, you can
check out the developer manual
`here <https://drwhut.github.io/decision/developer>`_!
